    <h5>A funny story..</h5>
    <p> I used to go to boarding school and one day, we had a school trip early in the morning so the gates were still closed. <br> I forgot to inform the staff the day before so I had to climb over a large, spired fence. <br> However, as I jumped, my sweatpants was pinned by one of the spires and I just hung there, <br> experiencing the most embarrassing wedgie in the entire galaxy. <br> A group effort was made to lift me off the spire and I had never known peace at school ever since that event.
      <h6>TL;DR</h6>
    My sweatpants got stuck on a high fence and I dangled there like a loser.
